## Tic Tac Toe Project
In this project I created a Tic Tac Toe game with JavaScript. It is a very simple project with silly sounds, they had us get our own. 
It also has a computer_player, the computer AI could definitely be much more challenging.

## Calculator Project
In this folder I created a very simple calculater using JavaScript.

## Pizza Project
A basic webpage displaying pizza sizes and toppings. The price adjusts depending on what you select. 
I found it interesting how the loops and indexes come together to make it work.

## React Exercises

In these excerises I learned how to create component classes, 
.createfactory which makes objects able to create other objects, setInterval function and more!

## AJAX

Practiced the basics of Ajax and learned about the Asynchronous Communication potential it has.
